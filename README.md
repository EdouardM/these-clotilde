## Getting Started

### Get
Clone or download this repo. Check out GitHub's links to the right if you need some help.

### Create
Open `slides/input.md` in your favourite text editor.

This is the source for your entire presentation. Inside you will find an example presentation that demonstrates how to use FsReveal.

### Build
Open a console/terminal and `cd` into the FsReveal folder.

If you're using Windows run 
    
    build.cmd
    
If you're using a Mac run

    ./build.sh
    
This will download all of the packages that FsReveal needs to create your slides.

Your slides are generated and saved to the `output` folder.

A web server will start automatically and your presentation will be opened in your browser.

FsReveal will detect changes to your slides and generate them again for you; you just need to refresh your browser.

> We're working on auto refreshing the browser for you.

### Use
- Use the arrow keys to navigate left, right, up and down
- Press `Esc` to see an overview
- Press `f` to view in fullscreen
- Press `s` to see speaker notes. This only works when running your presentation from the web server.
